 # yum -y install yum-utils -  is used to install the yum-utils package on a system running a Linux distribution that uses the YUM package manager.
 # wget -P /etc/yum.repos.d https://xcat.org/files/xcat/repos/yum/latest/xcat-core/xcat-core.repo 
	- wget ->  is used to download a repository configuration file and place it in the specified directory.
	- -P /etc/yum.repos.d -> This option specifies the directory where the downloaded file should be saved.
	- https://xcat.org/files/xcat/repos/yum/latest/xcat-core/xcat-core.repo -> This is the URL of the file 
		you want to download. It's a repository configuration file for the xCAT (Extreme Cloud Administration Toolkit) core components. 
		The file will be named xcat-core.repo.
	
	
 # wget -P /etc/yum.repos.d https://xcat.org/files/xcat/repos/yum/xcat-dep/rh7/x86_64/xcat-dep.repo
 
 # yum -y install xCAT -> The name of the package
 
 # . /etc/profile.d/xcat.sh ->  is used to execute the contents of the xcat.sh script and thereby 
								update the environment variables for the current shell session.
								
 #	ifconfig ${sms_eth_internal} ${sms_ip} netmask ${internal_netmask} up
	- ifconfig eth1 192.168.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
	-	 to configure a network interface with a specific IP address and netmask. Here's the breakdown of the command.
	
 # chdef -t site dhcpinterfaces="xcatmn|${sms_eth_internal}"
	-	chdef -> is used in xCAT (Extreme Cloud Administration Toolkit) 
		to change or define attributes of xCAT objects. In this 
		case, it looks like you're trying to set the DHCP interfaces 
		for the xCAT management node (mn). Let's break down the command:
	-	-t site: Specifies that you are changing attributes of the xCAT site.
	-	dhcpinterfaces="xcatmn|${sms_eth_internal}": This is setting the dhcpinterfaces 
		attribute for the xCAT site. It is specifying that the DHCP server should listen on the specified network interface.
